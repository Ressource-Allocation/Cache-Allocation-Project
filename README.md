# Cache-Allocation-Project
The initiators of this project are Gabriel Guez and Nessim Oussedik, under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Andrea Araldo, at Télécom SudParis.

The purpose of this project is to implement machine learning methods to study resource allocation problems, that is how to share 
limited resources out among several agents.

Such problems do occur in various fields, be it economics, investments, advertising, production systems, and so on. 
This project revolves around network operators allocating their caches to content providers.

Théo Bouganim under the supervision of Assoc. Prof Andrea Araldo continued the project until the publication of an article at the ITC32 PhD Workshop
